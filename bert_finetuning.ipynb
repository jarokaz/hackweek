    "\n",
    "[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and other Transformer encoder architectures have been wildly successful on a variety of tasks in NLP (natural language processing). They compute vector-space representations of natural language that are suitable for use in deep learning models. The BERT family of models uses the Transformer encoder architecture to process each token of input text in the full context of all tokens before and after, hence the name: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. \n",

Especially comedy spoofs. \"Airplane\", \"The Naked Gun\" trilogy, \"Blazing Saddles\", \"High Anxiety\", and \"Spaceballs\" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. \"Pandemonium\" is not up there with those films. Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it. Geez, \"Scream\" had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film. How bizarre is that?<br /><br />*1/2 (out of four)'\nLabel : 0 (neg)\nReview: b\"David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\nLabel : 0 (neg)\nReview: b'Great documentary about the lives of NY firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time.. That reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item.. What shocked me was not only the attacks, but the\"High Fat Diet\" and physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think a lot of Doctors would agree with me that,in the physical shape they were in, some of these firefighters would NOT of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear.

    "does in-graph replication with synchronous training on many GPUs on one machine.\n",
    "Essentially, it copies all of the model's variables to each processor.\n",
    "Then, it uses [all-reduce](http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/mpi-reduce-and-allreduce/) to combine the gradients from all processors and applies the combined value to all copies of the model.\n",
