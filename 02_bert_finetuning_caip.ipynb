Another mistake is to think that Falc\\xc3\\xa3o has been influenced by the series \"Hoje \\xc3\\xa9 Dia De Maria\". The TV series produced by Globo was made after the film, but aired before... Unfortunately.<br /><br />The negative point is the photography, by Walter Carvalho. It seems that he didn\\'t capture or understand the concept Falc\\xc3\\xa3o has created.
